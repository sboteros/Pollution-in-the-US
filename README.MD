# Introduction

We preliminarily analyzed the fine particulate matter emissions (PM2.5) in the
United States in the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. It plots several
information, such as: (a) total emissions in the United States, and in Baltimore
City; (b) emissions from coal-related sources in the United States, and in
Baltimore City; and, (c) emissions from vehicle sources in Baltimore City and
Los Angeles County.

# Data

We used data from de National Emissions Inventory (NEI), released by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The database used is available
[here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip), and
its contents are explained in the [Code Book](CodeBook.MD).

# Software

We used the software [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/), version 3.5.2. 
We used the libraries [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), 
[`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), and
[`here`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/here/versions/0.1)
